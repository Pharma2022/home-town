This is a Solo Project from the Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Path Module 2- Web Dev Basics. 

This will provide information about my Home Town: London . 




Additional Features:

-Flex-wrap wrap to make this more responsive to screen size

-Media Query to change flex-direction of card content. 

-Transform property on the images, when on hover or focus to increase in size




I might:


-Code this with Tailwind CSS (just because I am fairly new to tailwind CSS and want to build simple projects with it an develop increasing complexity )

-Add links to Westfield, Big Ben and the London Eye

-Add a linked in button to the guide section
